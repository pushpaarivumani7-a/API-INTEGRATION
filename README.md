##This project is a responsive weather webpage designed to fetch and display real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap public API. It is built entirely using fundamental front-end web technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — making it an ideal beginner-friendly application for understanding how to dynamically interact with APIs. The main objective of this project is to allow users to input the name of any city and instantly receive current weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions like clear sky or rain. Once a user enters the city name and clicks the “Get Weather” button, a JavaScript function is triggered. This function uses the fetch() API to send an asynchronous HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap endpoint. The request includes the entered city name and a unique API key, which is generated by signing up on the OpenWeatherMap platform. If the city is valid, the API returns a JSON response containing various weather metrics, which the script then parses and displays dynamically within the webpage. The webpage is designed to be responsive using CSS media queries, ensuring that it renders cleanly and consistently across devices ranging from mobile phones to desktop computers. Visual components such as input fields and buttons are styled to be user-friendly, while the layout adjusts smoothly to various screen sizes. Error handling is also incorporated to manage cases like invalid city names or network failures, providing appropriate feedback without crashing the interface. The project does not require any backend or server-side technology, and it runs entirely in the browser, making it easy to deploy using static hosting platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or even locally on a personal machine. No external frameworks or libraries are used, which helps keep the project lightweight and easy to understand. The tools used in this project include a simple code editor (such as Visual Studio Code), a modern browser (like Chrome or Firefox), and access to the OpenWeatherMap API service. Through this project, learners gain hands-on experience with core development concepts such as DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, API integration, and responsive design principles. This weather application has practical applications in multiple domains. It can serve as a simple widget on blogs or travel websites, be integrated into school and college projects, or even serve as the foundation for more complex weather dashboards or mobile apps. With further development, it could include features like five-day forecasts, location detection, or dark/light theme switching. The techniques demonstrated here are also transferable to other real-world applications like news feeds, cryptocurrency trackers, and stock tickers, where live data needs to be fetched from APIs and shown to users. In summary, this project offers a solid introduction to building dynamic and interactive webpages. It combines the power of public APIs with clean front-end design to deliver a functional, responsive, and engaging user experience, while also reinforcing fundamental programming skills essential for modern web development.
